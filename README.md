# 💻 Laptop Price Analysis (EDA + Feature Engineering)

A comprehensive analysis of 1,300+ laptop records to understand the factors that influence laptop pricing.  
This project focuses on cleaning, feature engineering, data visualization, and deriving actionable insights.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores how different hardware components — such as **CPU, GPU, RAM, storage type, and display features** — affect laptop prices.  
The goal was to engineer meaningful features and visualize trends to identify key price drivers.

## 🛠 Skills & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
- **Feature Engineering**

---

## 📈 Key Insights

1. **CPU & GPU brand** strongly influence price.  
2. **Touchscreen** and **IPS display** laptops are priced **20–30% higher** on average.  
3. **SSD-based laptops** offer better value and significantly higher pricing compared to HDD.  
4. Engineered features like `CPU_BRAND`, `TouchScreen`, `IPS`, and `Storage_Type` helped improve analysis clarity.

## 🧹 Tasks Performed

- Cleaned missing values and standardized data formats.
- Engineered **15+ new features**, including:
  - `CPU_BRAND`
  - `TouchScreen`
  - `IPS`
  - `Storage_Type`
- Created distribution plots, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
- Identified patterns and outliers influencing laptop prices.
